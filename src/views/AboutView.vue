     <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>  I go by the name Sisipho Pepengweni. I was born an bred in a small town called 
Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape. I currently reside in Lower crosssroad, a small 
Township in Cape Town. I am an aspiring full stack developer who's interest is 
enhancing my professional skills and gaining professional experience in the field.
I spend most of my time on computers because I am intrigued by how these 
machines work. My love for coding developed when I attended a career exhibition
at UCT.
